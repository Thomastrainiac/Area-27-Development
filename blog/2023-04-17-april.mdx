# April

What a crazy month its been aye? Today I had a huge meeting with the team and we've gotten some really cool idea's going! I also finally got our budget approved for the next 6 months, which should hopefully help the team as an incentive.

## Water Filtration

I wanted the barrels to be physics based, for those who tuned into my last stream you wouldve seen me trying to figure this out, of course, its a much harder task than youd expect but I found a pretty cool way to do it with some constraints and other parts to stop the barrel from going off course, as you can see in the video below

I also wanted the rope that picks up the barrels to be as dynamic and nice looking as possible, this isnt your regular old rope constraint, the code changes the length dynamically to give it that swinging look

Please note this isnt refined yet. **The barrels will not be spawning as fast as you see there.** There's still some things i'd like to iron out with it, and the math for all the filtration has been a nightmare. (I could probably create an actually water filtration system in real life at this point)

## Build

The new rebuild has been going great, here's some images of how things started for one of the sectors

***And now, it looks like this***

We're also working on pushing the run-down feel so BO2 put this together too

### KEEP IN MIND NONE OF THESE ARE FINAL PRODUCT AND ARE DUE TO BE REVISED

Honestly I wish I had more for you, but sadly I don't really. According to the other scripters on the project, there's currently a studio bug not allowing them to play test the game, we've tried to submit bug reports but Bt hasnt been able to due to some restricitions from the site. (Hence why no teaser)

I do have one more thing though . . . some ideas.

We plan on implementing a tram system. We had this idea years ago right after v2 came out, but we decided to scrap it due to issue's with how SCP's would breach between sectors, travel lag, etc, but after today's meeting the whole team was able to come up with an innovative way to make that all happen. I would share the models and some of the build but im still trying to make sure we actually own the tram models and don't want to share images until im 100% sure, but as soon as I know ill post again showing what they look like and what the track looks like.

Im also going to be doing a weekly, or bi-weekly depending on the difficulty, SCP showing, were I show a fully scripted SCP. The model may be the same as 47 for some, but none of the code is shared on the SCP's between 47 and 27, so you'll be seeing something completley new!

Thats all I have, with the new budget im sure things will move much quicker, especially since there's now more money that can be poured into comissions for smaller systems.

Thats all I have for now, but I hope this is enough to hold you all over! See ya soon!
